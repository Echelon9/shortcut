## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Shortcut Code of Conduct](https://github.com/FeelTrainCoop/shortcut/wiki/Shortcut-Code-of-Conduct). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [hello@feeltrain.com](mailto:hello@feeltrain.com).

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

Please don't file an issue to ask a question! Instead, join our [support chat](https://gitter.im/shortcut-support/) and we'll get back to you on there.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Shortcut.

Before submitting a report, please **perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+repo%3Afeeltraincoop%2Fshortcut+label%3Abug)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

You submit a bug report by [opening an issue on Github](https://github.com/FeelTrainCoop/shortcut/issues/new). We provide an [issue template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) for bug reports so if you fill in the blanks there, you should be good to go! Basically we want to know:

* What the expected vs observed behavior is
* What operating system and web browser you observed it on
* Exact steps to reproduce the problem (for example: "load the site, click an episode, scroll to the bottom of the page, select any text with an exclamation point")

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Shortcut, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Just like bugs, you can suggest an enhancement by [opening an issue on Github](https://github.com/FeelTrainCoop/shortcut/issues/new). Create an issue on that repository, delete the issue template that's filled in by default, and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to users.
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Pull Requests

* Fill in [the required template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible
* Follow the [JavaScript](#javascript-styleguide) styleguide

## Styleguides
We like to keep things consistent! Here are some style guides we try to follow. Nobody's perfect but please keep these in mind when contributing.

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally (use their issue/PR numbers, like `#22`)

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript should adhere to the [idiomatic JavaScript guidelines](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js), specifically [the style section](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js). We won't reject a PR on a style basis but we might request some changes!

## Additional Notes

This contribution guide is heavily based on [the contribution guide for Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
